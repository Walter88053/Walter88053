- 👋 Hi, I’m @Walter88053.  My full name is John WALTER Kowal
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a career change.  I spent many years designing piping systems using many CAD packages on different OS platforms.  There is no more work due to the inability to get projects approved.  CAD has become a devalued skill set.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code python.  My long term goal is to learn LUA for game development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any python project, even where the employer will take me on as a trainee and hopefully remotely.
- 📫 How to reach me?  My email is janek51d@hotmail.com.  My cell is 508-942-0028.
- 😄 Pronouns: ?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am 72 years old. I am the biological father of a 16 year old boy and a 14 year old girl. Really. I have Donald Trump beat.
